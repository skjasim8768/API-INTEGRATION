##about project
My Live Data Project (Weather, News, Date)
This is a simple web project made by me using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project, I created four HTML files — home.html, weather.html, news.html, and date.html. Each page has its own use. The main idea of this project is to show live data using API integration. This project helped me understand how to use JavaScript with APIs to display real-time information on a web page.

1. Home Page (home.html)
The home page is the starting point of my project. It has three buttons: Weather, News, and Date. When I click on any button, it takes me to the respective page. I used simple JavaScript and window.location.href to link the pages. I also added some CSS to make the page look clean and responsive for mobile devices. The background color is purple and the buttons have a hover effect.

2. Weather Page (weather.html)
This page shows live weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. When the page loads, there is a button. When I click the button, it asks me to enter a city name. After entering the name, the weather details of that city are shown. The data includes:

Temperature in °C

Weather condition (like Clear, Rainy, etc.)

Humidity

Wind Speed

I used JavaScript's fetch() function to call the API and get data. Then I used DOM methods to show the data on the screen. I also added basic styling to make the text and layout nice. This was a fun and interesting part of the project.

3. News Page (news.html)
This page shows the latest news headlines using the NewsAPI. When the page opens, it fetches the top 5 English news articles. For each article, it shows the title, a small description, and a link to read more. If the news can’t load, it shows an error message.

Here also I used fetch() and .then() methods to get and handle the API data. I displayed each article using a loop and added them to a div using innerHTML. This page helped me learn how to deal with lists of data and show them in a loop.

4. Date Page (date.html)
This page shows the current date, time, day, and local time zone. When I click the button, it displays the information using JavaScript’s Date object. I also used a little RegEx to find the timezone. This page does not use any API. It only uses built-in JavaScript features to show date and time.

Design and Style
All pages have the same color theme (purple background with white or dark text). The buttons have a rounded shape and hover effect. I used media queries to make sure the layout works on small devices like phones. The design is simple but clean.

What I Learned
From this project, I learned:

How to use APIs with JavaScript

How to use fetch() to get live data

How to show data on a webpage using DOM

How to design simple responsive web pages

How to create a multi-page website and navigate between them

This project was helpful for improving my frontend skills. It was simple but very useful for practice.
